    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you practiced different ways to know your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You explored your data over several dimensions and views to bring your raw data to a state of processed data, ready to be used for your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "You needed to understand a short business scenario and corresponding dataset. You analyzed the data using descriptive statistics to better understand it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You used visualization tools, including box and whisker plots and histograms, to support this analysis and understand the distribution of your data. You applied multivariate statistics with the help of scatter plots to spot correlations between features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **question 1**, you discovered the importance of a first glance at your data. You looked at how many features there were and how many samples. You looked at the first lines to see if anything caught your attention, such as missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **question 2**, you learned and practiced how to decide whether to remove or impute missing values. In the case of imputation, you practiced how to handle numerical or categorical imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions 3** gave you an understanding of basic statistics that you can apply to your data. You practiced plotting the distribution of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **question 4**, you practiced with another important plot for numerical features: the box and whisker plot. This is a great tool for spotting outliers. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 5** showed you an interesting guideline for removing outliers using percentiles. You were challenged to implement the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in **question 6** you learned and practiced using multivariate techniques, such as a correlation matrix and scatter plot, to spot correlations between features and how to deal with that."
